❓ short explanation on what:
            ⭐ node is ,
                 🌟 Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, 
                    back-end JavaScript runtime environment 
                    that runs on the V8 engine and executes
                    JavaScript code outside a web browser. 
            ⭐  event queue ?
                      🌟It pushes events onto the call stack, also built in, as they occur.
            ⭐ single and multi thread?  
                      🌟Node.js runs JavaScript code in a single thread, which means that your code can only do one task at  a time. However, Node.js itself is multithreaded and provides hidden threads through the libuv  library, which handles I/O operations like reading files from a disk or network requests. 
            ⭐ type of node module : 👉core module , 👉 contributed module , 👉 custom module
